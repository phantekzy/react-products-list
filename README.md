# React Products List

A beginner friendly React project that displays a list of products with search and filter functionality. Users can type in the search bar to filter products by name and use a checkbox to show only the products that are in stock. This project demonstrates the use of React components, props, and the useState hook for managing state. Itâ€™s a simple but solid example of how to build interactive UIs with React.

Features:
- Display products grouped by category (e.g., Fruits, Vegetables)
- Search bar to filter products by name
- Checkbox to filter only available (stocked) products
- Products not in stock are displayed in red

Tech Stack:
